## Description

Write a concise description of the code or module that needs improving.

## Business case

What is the business case for investing in this work?

## Current state

List the specific files or functions that are targeted for refactoring. Describe the current issues or pain points in this code, eg. complexity, redundancy, or maintainability.

## Goals

Describe the desired state of the code after refactoring. Specify what improvements are expected, eg. better maintainability, reduced code duplication, or easier testing.

## Impact

List any dependencies or other parts of the codebase that might be affected by the refactoring.

## Risks

Assess the potential risks associated with the refactoring, and how they will be mitigated.

## Methodology

Outline the steps or strategies for refactoring. This may include breaking down large functions, renaming variables, improving code structure, etc. Mention any tools or techniques that could be used during the refactoring process, such as code analysis tools, automated system tests, or design patterns that could be used as a bridge to the new design.

Suggest a testing strategy that will give sufficient confidence that the refactoring does not introduce regressions. Which tests will be the most important to protect from regressions - eg. unit, integration, or system tests? Will test coverage need to be extended beforehand? If so, which tests will need to be added?

## Additional notes

Add any other context, background information, or references that might be helpful in understanding the requirements.
