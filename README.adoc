This repository holds the source files, build and deployment scripts for my blog, https://kieranpotts.com/[kieranpotts.com].

== Documentation

=== Requirements

To set up a local development environment for this project, the following software must installed locally:

* Node ^v20.9.0
* NPM ^v10.1.0

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[NVM for Unix] or https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[NVM for Windows] makes it easier to switch between different versions of Node for different projects.
NVM for Windows does https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/388[not support] the `.nvmrc` file, so Windows users must specify the version number on the command line.

[source,shell]
----
nvm use
----

[source,shell]
----
nvm use 20.9.0

=== Dependencies

This project has only development dependencies, which are defined in the repository-level `package.json` file.

To install the development dependencies, run:

[source,shell]
----
npm install
----

=== Run-scripts

The following run-scripts are available. Use `npm run [command]`, eg. `npm run dev:start`.

* `dev:start` runs a clean development build, starts the development server, and sets up watchers, so subsequent changes to _some_ source files are automatically rebuilt and reloaded into the web server. The development server runs from `localhost:8080`. There's also an interface to BrowserSync, the dev server, from `localhost:8081`. Type `Ctrl`+`C` to stop the server.

* `prod:build` produces a clean, production-ready build in the `dist` directory. The artifacts produced by this command are intended to be shipped to production.

* `prod:serve` statically serves the contents of the built `dist` directory using a server that closely approximates the production environment, for example by enabling Netlify redirects and custom headers. Live reload is *not* enabled for this server, since this environment is intended to closely approximate the production environment. Use this to manually verify the output of `prod:build` before releasing the changes to production systems. The server runs on `localhost:8080`. Type `Ctrl`+`C` to stop the server.

=== Git workflow

This repository has only a single branch, `dev`. Updates to the this branch in the upstream reference repository are automatically deployed to production on Netlify.

`*.adoc` files in the `src` repository that are prefixed with at least one underscore character will NOT be deployed to production. This is useful for drafts and other content that is not ready for publication.
