= Continuous adaptation

Software development is broadly two activities:

* Implementing functional and non-functional requirements in software

* Getting better at how we do that.

We talk about "continuous improvement", but really we need to focus on
constantly adapting our processes and our tools to changing circumstances:
the changing needs of the business, changing requirements, changing
technologies, changing teamsâ€¦
