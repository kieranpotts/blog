There are several problems with the JavaScript name. Is it time to rebrand
JavaScript? If so, what should we call it?

An interesting question was asked recently in LinkedIn's JavaScript group:

Does JavaScript need to be renamed?

The question really got me thinking.

There's no doubt there are problems with JavaScript's branding:

* The official specification for the language is actually called ECMAScript – a
rather jarring and clumsy bit of branding by the standards organization that
oversees the language's specification, Ecma International.

* {link-mdn}[The JavaScript reference section] on the Mozilla Developer Network
(MDN) describes a subset of ECMAScript. Every documented feature is implemented
in at least one mainstream web browser, and therefore this is regarded as the
main manual for the "living" implementation of JavaScript. The problem is the
word "JavaScript" is also widely used to refer to different ECMAScript supersets,
notably {link-web-apis}[web APIs] and {link-node-apis}[Node APIs].

* JavaScript is a trademark of Oracle Corporation, which doesn't fit comfortably
with the language's position as a central component of the web platform, which
is meant to be built entirely from open technologies and standards.

* There isn't even an official logo for JavaScript, let alone a cute mascot like
Go's gopher or PHP's elephant.

* And famously, JavaScript is unrelated to Java. This has confused the hell out
of non-technical managers and recruiters for decades.

But for me, the big problem with the name JavaScript is its fuzzy scope. If a
computer program is documented as having been written in JavaScript, that does
not tell me everything I need to know to run the program. I do not know:

* The minimum version of ECMAScript with which the program is compatible, or
(alternatively) what JavaScript engines or runtime environments the program
supports.

* What host APIs – language extensions added by the runtime environment – the
program depends on. Is the program intended to run "client-side" (in a web
browser), "server-side" (in Node.js or another runtime environment), or is it
universal?

The confusion is demonstrated by the difficulty of consuming third party
libraries. Browse GitHub for open source JavaScript packages that solve a
particular problem, and for each solution you must dig deep into the README or
the `package.json` file to discover if that particular JavaScript package is
compatible with your own JavaScript application. (The problem is made worse by
the current period of transition between module systems: from community-derived
conventions such as CommonJS, AMD and UMD, towards ECMAScript's standard
module notation.)

Rebranding JavaScript might help to clear up all this confusion.

== A new name for JavaScript

If we did rebrand JavaScript, what would we call it?

JavaScript has already had lots of names. Brendan Eich – who designed and
implemented the first version of the language – had used the codename "Mocha"
to refer to his project, but the marketing boffins at Netscape called it
LiveScript when it was first shipped in an early beta of the Navigator 2.0
browser, before settling on the name JavaScript for the final public release at
the end of 1995 – apparently in an attempt to piggyback on the popularity of
Java, an entirely unrelated language.

Alternative implementations of the language were called JScript (Microsoft's
version for its Internet Explorer browser) and ActionScript (Adobe's version).
And various dialects of JavaScript that have enjoyed their time in the sun over
the years include CoffeeScript and, today, TypeScript.

I think Eich was on the right track all along. *Mocha* is a great name. In the
software space, this name conflicts only with the {link-mocha}[Mocha test
framework] for Node.js and a legacy decompiler for Java.

But my personal preference is to rename JavaScript to, simply, *JS*.

Most people refer to JavaScript by its acronym, anyway. It matches the official
file extension. And we could turn that ubiquitous black-on-yellow community
logo into the official emblem and not have to remake all our merchandise.

Over time, the origins of the JS name would be largely forgotten, in the same
way most PHP developers couldn't tell you what PHP stands for.

== Flavors and versions

What would be better still is to come up with a standard convention to refer
to the extended APIs made available to JS programs by particular runtime
environments for the purpose of communication with the host system.

For example, if today's ECMAScript becomes JS, then something like *WebJS* could
become the official name for the JS superset that is supported in web browsers,
as specified by the World Wide Web Consortium.

And perhaps there could be a *ServerJS* standard that specifies additional APIs
that are expected to be provided by server-side JavaScript runtimes such as
Node.js.

Finally, ECMAScript's yearly release cycle and versioning convention is hugely
convenient, and this should be extended to all flavours of the newly rebranded
JS. Thus, *WebJS 2020* would refer to a snapshot of ECMAScript plus all the web
APIs that are standardized as of the year 2020.
