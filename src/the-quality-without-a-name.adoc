:description: The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander is a classic text on real-world architecture. In computing, it was influential in the emerging field of object-oriented programming in the 1980s and 1990s. The book still has much to teach us about how we think about software design.

Christopher Alexander’s _The Timeless Way of Building_ is a classic text in architectural theory, widely admired for its provocative view of urban design. Beyond architecture, its influence reached into the field of computing, shaping the evolution of object-oriented programming during the 1980s and 1990s. Decades later, it continues to offer lessons in how to approach software design, reminding us that the habitability of a codebase is just as importance as its structural elegance.

My holiday reading this year was {link-wikipedia}[_The Timeless Way of Building_] by Christopher Alexander. Published in 1979 and now regarded as a classic text in the field of built environment architecture, the book is a philosophical and practical exploration of the patterns that make some buildings and places feel alive, harmonious, and emotionally resonant.

Alexander calls this the quality-without-a-name. It's that _je ne sais quoi_ that some buildings and urban spaces have, that can't be easily expressed in words, but we know it when we experience it.

[quote, Christopher Alexander 1979]

The first place I think of when I try to tell someone about this quality is a corner of an English country garden where a peach tree grows against a wall.

The wall runs east to west; the peach tree grows flat against the southern side. The sun shines on the tree and, as it warms the bricks behind the tree, the warm bricks themselves warm the peaches on the tree. It has a slightly dozy quality. The tree, carefully tied to grow flat against the wall; warming the bricks; the peaches growing in the sun; the wild grass growing around the roots of the tree, in the angle where the earth and roots and wall all meet.

This quality is the most fundamental quality there is in anything.
____

The central premise of the book is that this elusive architectural characteristic does not need to be left to emerge by accident. It can be intentionally designed through the reuse of timeless design patterns that recur throughout history and across cultures.

The quality-without-a-name comes about, not from adherence to any particular architectural style or trend, but from a deep understanding of human needs and the rhythms of life. Buildings and urban spaces feel alive when they are thoughtfully shaped to support universal patterns of human experience, rather than being designed for the sake of aesthetic fashion or architectural exhibition.

This is the "timeless way of building" referenced in the book’s title. It is a natural, organic process that has shaped architecture across cultures for centuries.

The timeless way of building draws on universal patterns that have emerged independently around the world and that have been passed down through generations of builders and architects. These patterns appear in villages, temples, and homes across time and geography.

These "living patterns" are rooted in human needs and lived experiences. When the patterns are carefully combined and adjusted to fit the needs of the inhabitants, they give rise to buildings and urban environments that are functional, beautiful, and emotionally satisfying. Such spaces are imbued with that intangible quality — the quality-without-a-name.

Alexander contrasts the timeless way of building with modern architectural styles and industrialized construction methods, which tend to produce buildings that are missing this indescribable quality.

I was reading this wonderful book while holidaying in Dubai, a city characterized by its showpiece mega-projects, the effect of which is a rather soulless, rootless, global urban landscape. Yet even here I found a few places hidden among the glass and steel towers – some heritage buildings and human-scale sanctuaries like https://alserkal.online/[Alserkal Avenue] – that have something of the quality-without-a-name within them.

Alexander's work has been influential in other fields beyond architecture.  His design philosophy found popularity in the field of software design in the 1980s and 1990s, during the development of object-oriented programming and its associated design patterns.

Richard P Gabriel, the computer scientist known for his work related to the Lisp programming language, explored Alexander's ideas in the context of software design through a series of articles published in the _Journal of Object-Oriented Programming_. Gabriel later compiled these essays into a book titled _Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community_, published in 1996 and now {link-patterns-of-software}[available freely from his website]. Christopher Alexander wrote the forward to Gabriel's book. It is a wonderful anthology of essays, full of ideas that are still pertinent today.

Gabriel was an early advocate of applying Alexander's concept of pattern languages to software design. He argued that software systems, like buildings, can benefit from the use of recurring design patterns that address universal needs in software.

Today, the idea of design patterns is well established in the field of software development. The influential book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_, published in 1994 by the "Gang of Four", provided us with a shared vocabulary for describing common object-oriented patterns. We all use that vocabulary in our communication of software design ideas.

But there is another idea from Gabriel's essays that I find particularly compelling and relevant to software design.

It's the idea of *habitability*.

In software design, habitability is a characteristic of a software system that refers to how comfortably software developers can live and work with the codebase, how intuitively they can navigate and understand it, and how confidently they can modify it.

Gabriel draws the metaphor of habitability from Alexander's architectural philosophy. Just as buildings must be livable for their generations of occupants, so software systems must be habitable spaces for the generations of programmers who analyze, maintain, and extend them.

[quote, Richard P Gabriel]
____
There is a pleasure in creating well-written, understandable programs. There is a satisfaction in finding a program structure that tames the complexity of an application. We enjoy seeing our algorithms expressed clearly and persuasively. We also profit from our clearly written programs, for they are much more likely to be correct and maintainable than obscure ones.
____

You most commonly find the quality of habitability in smaller programs, particularly open source projects maintained by a single developer, or at least guided by a https://producingoss.com/en/benevolent-dictator.html[benevolent dictator]. Such programs tend to have high conceptual integrity, meaning their design is coherent and consistent throughout. They are well-factored, with good separation of concerns and modularity, enough that individual parts can be understood and modified in isolation of all the other parts. Consistent coding conventions, concise documentation, and comprehensive tests make these software projects accessible to easily external contributors, both expert and novice. Critically, design decisions prioritize ease of understanding and changeability of the code.

Many of the great free and open source projects are wonderfully habitable spaces for computer programmers. They must be. The success of such software projects depends on programmers being willing to donate their time to them.

The challenge is to maintain habitability in large, complex software systems that are developed through peacemeal change by revolving teams of programmers over many years.

In software design, requirements are not static. Business priorities shift, technologies advance, vulnerabilities surface, regulations tighten. Users may use applications in suprisingly ways. Even isolated programs depend on changing hardware, operating systems, and runtime environments, demanding ongoing maintenance.

Software is never truly finished. Developers must continuously adapt it, adding features, removing features, tuning performance, fixing bugs, updating dependencies, patching vulnerabilities, migrating data, and scaling capacity to meet ever-changing requirements.

All this constant, perpetual change makes it hard to maintain a codebase as a habitable space.

Christopher Alexander’s design philosophy offers a way to think about how we can preserve habitability in structures that are always changing. Drawing on examples from Alexander's work, Gabriel contrasts two different approaches to design: the modern skyscraper and the New England farmhouse:

[quote, Richard P Gabriel]
____
A modern skyscraper[…] has a fixed inflexible interior, which is secondary to the designed beauty of the exterior. Little attention is paid to the natural light, and often the interiors are constructed as “flexible office space,” which means cubicles. The flexibility is for management to set up offices for the company, not for the inhabitants—the employees—to tailor their own space. When you run out of space in the skyscraper, you build another; you don't modify the existing one or add to it.

Contrast this with the New England farmhouse. It starts as a small home with a barn out back. As the family grows and the needs of the farm grow, a back room is added to the house, then a canning room, then a room for grandma; stables are added to the barn, then a wing for milking more cows. Finally the house and barn are connected because it is too difficult to get from the house to the barn in a blizzard. The result is rambling, but each part is well-suited to its needs, each part fits well with the others, and the result is beautiful because it is a living structure with living people inside. The inhabitants are able to modify their environment because each part is built according to familiar patterns of design, use, and construction and because those patterns contain the seeds for piecemeal growth.
____

Today, we tend to think of the construction of physical buildings as being one-off projects that are fully designed and planned up-front, then constructed in a single step. But this stepwise approach to the built environment is a relatively recent phenomenon. For most of human history, buildings were constructed incrementally, evolving over time to meet the changing needs of their changing inhabitants.

[quote, Christopher Alexander (1975)]
____
Each new building is not a “finished” thing… They are never torn down, never erased; instead they are always embellished, modified, reduced, enlarged, improved. This attitude to the repair of the environment has been commonplace for thousands of years in traditional cultures. We may summarize the point of view behind this attitude in one phrase: piecemeal growth.
____

The development of software has more in common with the traditional way of building than the modern one. The software systems that prove to have long and useful lives tend to have more in common with a New England farmhouse than a modern skyscraper. They are developed incrementally, through piecemeal growth, by various people who come and go.

For every incremental change, the design is iterated to accommodate the changing requirements and to maintain conceptual integrity in the overall design. Thus, habitability is maintained through continuous redesign.
