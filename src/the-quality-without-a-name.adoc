= The (software) quality without a name
Kieran Potts, XXXXXXXXX September 2025
:description: The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander is a classic text on real-world architecture. In computing, it was influential on the emerging field of object-oriented programming in the 1980s and 1990s. The book still has more to teach us about how we think about software design.

My holiday reading this year was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building[_The Timeless Way of Building_] by Christopher Alexander. Published in 1979 and now regarded as a classic text on (real world) architecture, the book is a philosophical and practical exploration of the patterns that make buildings and places feel alive, harmonious, and emotionally resonant.

Alexander calls this the "quality without a name". It's that _je ne sais quoi_ that some buildings and urban spaces have, that can't be easily expressed in words – but we know it when we experience it.

[quote, Christopher Alexander 1979]
____
The first place I think of when I try to tell someone about this quality  is a corner of an English country garden where a peach tree grows against a wall.

The wall runs east to west; the peach tree grows flat against the  southern side. The sun shines on the tree and, as it warms the bricks behind the tree, the warm bricks themselves warm the peaches on the tree. It has a slightly dozy quality. The tree, carefully tied to grow flat against the wall; warming the bricks; the peaches growing in the sun; the wild grass growing around the roots of the tree, in the angle where the earth and roots and wall all meet.

This quality is the most fundamental quality there is in anything.

The central premise of the book is that this architectural characteristic does not emerge by accident, but rather it can be intentionally designed through the use of timeless design patterns that recur throughout history and across cultures.

The quality-without-a-name comes about, not from adherence to any particular architectural style or trend, but from a deep understanding of human needs and the rhythms of life. Buildings and urban spaces "feel alive" when they support universal patterns of human experience.

This "timeless way of building" is a natural, organic process that has existed for centuries. It is based on architectural "pattern languages" that have emerged independently in different parts of the world and that have been passed down through generations of builders and architects. These design patterns are not rigid structures but rather are flexible guidelines that evolve through use and adaptation. The patterns are deeply rooted in human needs and experiences. They help create spaces that are not only aesthetically beautiful or efficient, but which are functional and emotionally satisfying, too.

The same patterns are seen in villages, temples, and homes throughout the world and through time. Used together, these timeless patterns produce buildings and urban landscapes that have the quality-without-a-name.

Alexander contrasts the timeless way of building with modern global architectural styles, and industrialized construction methods, which tend to produce buildings that are missing this indescribable quality.

The irony is not lost on me that I was reading this book while holidaying in Dubai, a city characterized by its spectacular mega-projects, the effect of which is a rather soulless, rootless, global urban landscape. Yet even here I found a few places dotted among the glass and steel towers – some heritage buildings and archaeological sites, and places like Alserkal Avenue – that exhibit many of the characteristics of the timeless way of building.

_The Timeless Way of Building_ – and other books in Alexander's series, notably the follow-up _A Pattern Language_ – have been influential in other fields beyond architecture. Notably, Alexander's work was influential in software design, particularly through the 1980s and 1990s during the development of object-oriented programming and its associated design patterns.

Richard P Gabriel, the computer scientist known for his work related to the Lisp programming language, explored Alexander's ideas in the context of software design through a series of articles published in the _Journal of Object-Oriented Programming_. Gabriel later compiled these essays into a book titled _Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community_, published in 1996 and now {link-patterns-of-software}[available freely from his website]. (Christopher Alexander wrote the forward to the Gabriel's book.) It's a wonderful anthology of essays, still very much pertinent today, and I encourage you to download and read it.

Gabriel was an early advocate of applying Alexander's concept of "pattern languages" to software design.
