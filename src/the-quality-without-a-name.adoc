_The Timeless Way of Building_ by Christopher Alexander is a classic text on real-world architecture. In computing, it was influential in the emerging field of object-oriented programming in the 1980s and 1990s. The book still has much to teach us about how we think about software design.

My holiday reading this year was {link-wikipedia}[_The Timeless Way of Building_] by Christopher Alexander. Published in 1979 and now regarded as a classic text in the field of built environment architecture, the book is a philosophical and practical exploration of the patterns that make some buildings and places feel alive, harmonious, and emotionally resonant.

Alexander calls this the quality-without-a-name. It's that _je ne sais quoi_ that some buildings and urban spaces have, that can't be easily expressed in words, but we know it when we experience it.

The first place I think of when I try to tell someone about this quality is a corner of an English country garden where a peach tree grows against a wall.

The wall runs east to west; the peach tree grows flat against the southern side. The sun shines on the tree and, as it warms the bricks behind the tree, the warm bricks themselves warm the peaches on the tree. It has a slightly dozy quality. The tree, carefully tied to grow flat against the wall; warming the bricks; the peaches growing in the sun; the wild grass growing around the roots of the tree, in the angle where the earth and roots and wall all meet.

This quality is the most fundamental quality there is in anything.

The central premise of the book is that this elusive architectural characteristic does not need to be left to emerge by accident. It can be intentionally designed through the reuse of timeless design patterns that recur throughout history and across cultures.

The quality-without-a-name comes about, not from adherence to any particular architectural style or trend, but from a deep understanding of human needs and the rhythms of life. Buildings and urban spaces feel alive when they are designed to support universal patterns of human experience, rather than being designed for, say, aesthetic fashion or architectural showcase.

This is the "timeless way of building" referenced in the book’s title. It is a natural, organic process that has shaped architecture across cultures for centuries.

The timeless way of building draws on universal patterns that have emerged independently around the world and that have been passed down through generations of builders and architects. These patterns appear in villages, temples, and homes across time and geography.

These patterns are adaptable frameworks, rather than rigid formulas, rooted in human needs and lived experience. When the patterns are combined, they give rise to buildings and urban environments that are functional, beautiful, and emotionally satisfying. Such spaces are imbued with that intangible quality — the quality-without-a-name.

Alexander contrasts the timeless way of building with modern global architectural styles and industrialized construction methods, which produce buildings that are missing this indescribable quality.

The irony is not lost on me that I was reading this book while holidaying in Dubai, a city characterized by its spectacular mega-projects, the effect of which is a rather soulless, rootless, global urban landscape. Yet even here I found a few places hidden among the glass and steel towers – some heritage buildings and modern sanctuaries like https://alserkal.online/[Alserkal Avenue] – that exhibit some of the characteristics of the timeless way of building.

_The Timeless Way of Building_ – and other books in Alexander's series, notably the follow-up _A Pattern Language_ – have been influential in other fields beyond architecture. Alexander's work was popular in the field of software design, particularly through the 1980s and 1990s during the development of object-oriented programming and its associated design patterns.

Richard P Gabriel, the computer scientist known for his work related to the Lisp programming language, explored Alexander's ideas in the context of software design through a series of articles published in the _Journal of Object-Oriented Programming_. Gabriel later compiled these essays into a book titled _Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community_, published in 1996 and now {link-patterns-of-software}[available freely from his website]. Christopher Alexander wrote the forward to Gabriel's book, which is a wonderful anthology of essays, still very much pertinent today, and I encourage you to download and read it.

Gabriel was an early advocate of applying Alexander's concept of pattern languages to software design. He argued that software systems, like buildings, can benefit from the use of recurring design patterns that address universal needs in software.

Today, the idea of design patterns is well established in the field of software development. The book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_, published in 1994 by the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides), provided a shared vocabulary for describing common object-oriented patterns that is still the foundation for how we communicate software design ideas today.

But there is another idea from Gabriel's essays that I find particularly compelling and relevant to software design, but which has received less attention in the decades since.

It's the idea of *habitability*.

[quote, Richard P Gabriel]
____
There is a pleasure in creating well-written, understandable programs. There is a satisfaction in finding a program structure that tames the complexity of an application. We enjoy seeing our algorithms expressed clearly and persuasively. We also profit from our clearly written programs, for they are much more likely to be correct and maintainable than obscure ones.
